# Welcome to the documentation hub of the project POLVO

> So that anyone can detect cyber threats...

The **Polvo Project** delivers a lightweight agent that eases the load on security teams. It collects, analyzes, and abstracts diverse system logs into clear “actions” (we call them “traces”) in real time.

Most blue-team tools focus on gathering raw logs, dumping them into databases, and displaying them on complex dashboards. That approach makes your whole monitoring setup hard to observe and even harder to act on—valuable insights get buried under noise. We solve that by cutting through the clutter and surfacing only what you need to take action.
